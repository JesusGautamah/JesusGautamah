### Welcome!👋

👋 Hello, world! I'm Jesus Gautamah.

🔭 I'm a passionate developer from Santo André, São Paulo, Brazil. I love solving complex problems and building innovative solutions.

💻 I'm proficient in **Ruby**, and have used it in several of my projects on GitHub. I also have experience with **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization, ensuring my applications run smoothly across different environments.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm fascinated by the potential of these technologies to transform our world.

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects. I believe in the power of community and shared knowledge.

📫 Reach out to me on LinkedIn!

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outer space of coding.

Remember, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Let's take that step together!
